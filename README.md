Considerations:

- `notebook.ipynb`: We try to pose a small problem to have a better understanding about the paper "A Data Efficient Framework for Learning Local Heuristics" by Rishi Veerapaneni, Jonathan Park, Muhammad Suhail Saleem and Maxim Likhachev.

- `A_star.ipynb`: Implementation of $A^*$ and visualization for final presentation. Notebook based on [this repo](https://github.com/santifiorino/maps-pathfinding/blob/main/pathfinding.ipynb) by Santiago Fiorino.
