Considerations:

- `approach.ipynb`: We try to pose a small problem to have a better understanding about the paper "A Data Efficient Framework for Learning Local Heuristics" by Rishi Veerapaneni, Jonathan Park, Muhammad Suhail Saleem and Maxim Likhachev.

- `main.ipynb`: Main notebook in which results are presented for $A^*$ using global heuristic and local (calculated and approximatedd) heuristic. Implementation of $A^*$ and visualizations were based on [this repo](https://github.com/santifiorino/maps-pathfinding/blob/main/pathfinding.ipynb) by Santiago Fiorino.

- `DeLoHA.ipynb`: Backtracking for data recolection and training of the neural net are presentend.

- `videos1`: Visualization of $A^*$ running with all the considered heuristics.

- `modelos`: Model file used in `main.ipynb`
